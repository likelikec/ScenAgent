Based on typical drag-and-drop behavior in Android lists, I should press and hold near the center of the '上海' item (e.g., x ≈ 500, y ≈ 320) and drag it to a position above '巴黎' (e.g., y ≈ 200), keeping x roughly the same. A duration of 2.0 seconds ensures a smooth drag suitable for reordering.\n\n### Action ###\n{\"action\": \"swipe\", \"coordinate\": [500, 320], \"coordinate2\": [500, 200], \"duration\": 2.0}\n\n### Description ###\nDrag the '上海' entry upward from its current position to above '巴黎' to reorder it as the first item."}
