Currently, the screenshot shows the main weather screen with two locations: '巴黎' (Paris) and '上海' (Shanghai), where '巴黎' is currently selected (underlined), implying it's the first in the list. To achieve the goal, I need to: 1. Access the location management interface — typically reached via the menu (three horizontal lines icon at top-left). 2. In the manage locations screen, locate the '上海' entry. 3. Perform a drag operation to move '上海' to the top of the list (i.e., above '巴黎'). Since the current screen is the main weather view, the first step is to open the navigation drawer/menu to find the \"Manage Locations\" option. Based on typical app layouts (and the presence of the hamburger menu), this is the logical path. No extra input data is provided; the target app is Cirrus, and the only required action is reordering via drag. I will not assume hidden UI elements unless observed — but the menu icon is visible, so we start there.\n1. Click the menu icon (three horizontal lines) at the top-left corner to open the navigation drawer. 2. Locate and click the \"Manage Locations\" option in the navigation drawer. 3. On the manage locations page, drag the '上海' entry upward to the first position in the list (above '巴黎'). 4. Execute the `answer` action.",
