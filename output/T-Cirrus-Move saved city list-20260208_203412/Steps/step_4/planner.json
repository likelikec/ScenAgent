The user's goal is to move '上海' to the **first** position — but it is *already* at the top of the list. Therefore, no reordering is needed; the task is already satisfied. The previous action attempted a drag from y=320 to y=200, which likely tried to move '上海' upward — but since it’s already first, dragging further up has no effect or may not be possible. The current state confirms '上海' is first, so the goal is achieved. Thus, the plan should be marked as **Finished**.\nFinished",
